    <p>Dear Agent <span class="blurred">Glinda Upland</span>, We have an   emergency. The secret <span class="blurred">wedding with Elphaba</span> has been compromised</p>
    <p>We suspect that the <span class="blurred">Wizard</span> is behind this. He has taken the <span class="blurred">Elphaba</span> to his hidden cave. Your mission is to infiltrate the cave and secure <span class="blurred">Elphaba</span> before it's too late!</p>
    <p>Be sure to keep the cave's location confidential. Any leak of this information could jeopardize the entire operation.</p>
